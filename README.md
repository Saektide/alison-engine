# Alison Engine
Alison is a Node.js HTTP server engine to simplify the work of building an API.

# Quick start
1. Install deps with `yarn` command or `npm i` if you use only npm.
2. Test the integrity of the engine with the `testing/` folder.
```bash
cd testing/
node index.js
```
3. Do a sample request with some HTTP client, e.g. Insomnia.
4. If everything is ok, you're ready to build your backend app with Alison Engine.
